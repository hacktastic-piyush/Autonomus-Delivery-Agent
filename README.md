# Autonomus-Delivery-Agent
This project simulates an autonomous delivery agent navigating a city grid to find the most efficient path from a start point to a destination. It implements and compares three popular pathfinding algorithms: A* Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).

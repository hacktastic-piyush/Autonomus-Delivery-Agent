ü§ñ Autonomous Delivery Agent: Pathfinding Simulator üó∫Ô∏è
This project simulates an autonomous delivery agent navigating a city grid to find the most efficient path from a start point to a destination. It implements and compares three popular pathfinding algorithms: A* Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).

The core objective is to demonstrate how different algorithms solve the same problem, with a special focus on fuel optimization using the A* search algorithm.

‚ú® Features
A* Search: Finds the optimal path with the least "fuel" consumption (least number of steps).

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores a valid path to the goal, but does not guarantee the shortest or most efficient route.

Interactive Command-Line Interface: A simple menu allows you to choose which algorithm to run or to see all results at once.

Grid Visualization: The program outputs a clear, text-based visualization of the grid, highlighting the path found by the chosen algorithm.

üöÄ How to Run
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Save the file: Save the pathfinding_project.py file to your local machine.

Run from the terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the following command:

python pathfinding_project.py

Follow the prompts: The program will present a menu. Simply enter the number corresponding to the algorithm you wish to run.

üß†üí° Algorithms Explained
‚≠ê A* Search (Fuel Optimized)
A* is an intelligent pathfinding algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search. In this project, the heuristic is the Manhattan distance, which estimates the remaining distance to the goal. The algorithm prioritizes paths that have a low total cost, where the cost is the sum of fuel consumed and the estimated remaining fuel. This makes it ideal for finding the most fuel-efficient route.

üîç Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores the grid layer by layer, guaranteeing that it finds the shortest path in terms of steps. It is a simple and effective algorithm for unweighted grids but can be less efficient in large, complex environments compared to A*.

üå≥ Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. While it will find a valid path to the goal if one exists, it does not consider the path's length or cost. Therefore, the path found by DFS is often not the most efficient.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Summary
A* vs. BFS: In this grid, where each step has a uniform cost, both A* and BFS will find the shortest path, which also corresponds to the least fuel consumption.

DFS: DFS is included for comparison to show a non-optimal pathfinding strategy. The path it finds will be valid but could be significantly longer than the one found by A* or BFS.
